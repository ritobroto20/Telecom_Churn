# Telecom_Churn
This data set contains customer level information for a telecom company. Various attributes related to the services used are recorded for each customer.

I have tried to understand the behaviour of the data, along with what predictive model works the best. We tried to answer these 3 questions mainly-
1. Who are the customers more likely to churn?
2. What are the relations between some of the variables.!
3. What actions can be taken to stop them from leaving?
